# Food Image Classification

### A project that conduct classification of food images with the convolutional neural network model and model explanation techniques

## Task
Find the best sturcture of the model and conduct data normalization, dropout and weight decay to improve the accuracy.  
Moreover, implement the techniques of explainable AI to interpret how the model learns
